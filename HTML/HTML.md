# HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

- Meta tags are mostly used in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) tools.
- Meta is a character set.
- `<meta name="robots" content="INDEX, FOLLOW">` is used to make our website visible in the search engine.
- `<meta name="robots" content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">` is used to just do the vice-versa of the above one, like to make the website completely invisible and not to be followed by the search engine.
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="Prasen.css">` is used to link an external CSS file in the HTML file.
- `<script src="Prasen.js"></script>` is used to link an external JavaScript file in the HTML File.
