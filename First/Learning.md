# MetaData
- MetaData represents about the data
- MetaData enriches the data with information that makes it easier to find use and manage.

 
- In '<head>' we store - meta data, <title> tag as well as external sheets too.
- In <body> we store full content of the web Page.
- We use "<!---->" to comment out something in HTML.
- Use "ctrl + / " to quickly comment out the code in HTML and toggle it back. 

- Meta tags are mostly used in SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) tools.
- Meta is a character set.
- '<meta name="robots" content="INDEX, FOLLOW">' is used to make our website visible in Serach engine
- <meta name="robots" content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"> is used to just do the vice-versa of the above one, like to make the website completely invisible and not to followed by serach engine.
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="Prasen.css"> is used to link a external css file in the HTML file.
- <script src="Prasen.js"></script> is used to link a external JavaScript file in the HTML File.
