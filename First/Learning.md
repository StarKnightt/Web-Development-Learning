# MetaData
- MetaData represents about the data
- MetaData enriches the data with information that makes it easier to find use and manage.

 
- In '<head>' we store - meta data, <title> tag as well as external sheets too.
- In <body> we store full content of the web Page.
- We use "<!---->" to comment out something in HTML.
- Use "ctrl + / " to quickly comment out the code in HTML and toggle it back.
